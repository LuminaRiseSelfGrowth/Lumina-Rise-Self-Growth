            <h3>What Does It Mean to Thrive?</h3>
            <p>Thriving is the state of flourishing, prospering, and growing vigorously. It's about moving beyond merely coping or surviving to experiencing abundance, joy, and fulfillment across all areas of life.</p>
            
            <p>At Lumina Rise, we believe that thriving is your birthright. While life inevitably includes challenges, you can develop the skills and mindset needed to navigate difficulties with grace while continuing to grow and find meaning.</p>

                    <h3>Why Thriving Matters</h3>
                    <p>Many women find themselves stuck in survival mode—constantly reacting to demands, putting out fires, and just making it through the day. This reactive existence can leave you feeling drained, unfulfilled, and disconnected from your deeper purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>Research shows that people who move from surviving to thriving experience:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        <li>Greater sense of purpose and meaning</li>
                        <li>Enhanced ability to handle life's challenges</li>
                        <li>More creativity and innovation</li>
                        <li>Deeper, more satisfying relationships</li>
                        <li>Improved work performance and satisfaction</li>
                        <li>Higher overall life satisfaction and happiness</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>By developing the tools to thrive, you not only transform your own experience but also create positive ripple effects for everyone around you.</p>

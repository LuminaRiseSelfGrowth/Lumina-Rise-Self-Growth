            <h3>What is Wellness?</h3>
            <p>Wellness is an active pursuit of activities, choices, and lifestyles that lead to a state of holistic health. It goes beyond simply being free from illness and encompasses physical, mental, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental well-being.</p>
            
            <p>At Lumina Rise, we believe that true wellness comes from nurturing all dimensions of your health in an integrated way. Each aspect of wellness affects the others, creating a dynamic system that requires balance and attention.</p>
